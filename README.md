# MariaDB & PHP mysqli

## Introduction 

SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

The PHP programming language has long been considered a fairly light and simple solution for developers to use to create robust and creative web applications. In fact, that’s as true now as it has ever been as the past few versions of PHP have made the language more appealing than ever.

Like many other languages, PHP has the ability to take advantage of the power of MariaDB, and it’s actually a pretty simple and straightforward process.

# Download and Install Docker
To install docker you will just go to https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ and download the product for your operating system. 

Once you have downloaded docker, you can just have it running in the background, but just be aware that it can take a lot of your processing memory while it is running so it might slow some downloads or other systems down while it is running. So just don't have it running for fun. 

# Open a Code editor
For this tutorial I will be showing you how to code the necessary code through Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/download. I would reccommend it over others, but you can still accomplish this tutorial though other means as well.
