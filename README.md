Junior Core of Cybersecurity is by far the hardest in the major. I think many would agree that fall semester has been one for the books, and not in all of the best ways. Over this semester I have discovered how important taking care of your mental health is. Health is invaluable and should come before everything else because it is what allows us to work at our best. When I realized I hadn't been doing so well and I couldn't do it on my own I reached out to a professional to help me with some strategies to feel a bit better. 
Here are a few of the things my health professional / therapist told me. 

Physical Components

1. **Sleep and Mental Health:**
   Sleep deficiency significantly impacts mental and physical health. Adults typically require 7-8 hours of quality sleep for optimal well-being. Sleep deprivation can lead to impaired cognitive function, affecting decision-making, memory, and emotional regulation. It's associated with depression, risk-taking behavior, and difficulty coping with change.
   In my case, this means dealing with stress and the weight of school and work better along with navigating my emotions and relationships better. 

2. **Nutrition and Mood:**
   The gut-brain connection influences mood via the production of chemicals like dopamine and serotonin. Nutrient-rich diets support good bacteria growth, positively affecting chemical production. Sugar intake can cause mood swings due to spikes in dopamine. Conversely, whole foods, fiber, antioxidants, folate, vitamin D, magnesium, and fermented foods aid in stabilizing mood and mental health.
   Eating healthy full and balanced meals regularily will allow for more stable mood and energy. I know that many people, including myself, use energy drinks, caffine in any form to get energy, then balance it out with melatonin or other sleep medication. 

3. **Exercise and Mental Health:**
   Regular aerobic exercises (jogging, swimming, etc.) reduce anxiety and depression by improving blood circulation to the brain and influencing the body's response to stress. Physical activity positively impacts mood, self-esteem, cognitive function, and social interaction. Exercise benefits individuals with serious mental illnesses, aiding weight control, fitness levels, and overall health.
   Although our major makes it difficult to have much of a life outside assignments and projects, it doesn't mean it is impossible. It is possible to work, complete all of the assignments, and to still enjoy some hobbies. 


Ways to manage stress

1. Embrace physical activity as a mood booster. Whether it's a stroll, gym session, or yoga, find what you enjoy and commit to it regularly before finals. Use reminders or schedules to stick to this routine.

2. Value your meals. Prioritize a balanced diet with fruits, veggies, and proteins, especially as finals approach. Skip the sugars, and if resources are a concern, seek assistance from places like the Husker Pantry.

3. Break down your goals. Instead of overwhelming yourself, divide larger tasks into manageable steps. List them out and tick them off as you progress. This approach builds confidence as you conquer each step.

4. Connect with nature. Spending time outdoors can alleviate stress. Even if it's a short walk back home, relish the sunlight and fresh air. Take it slow, breathe deep, and absorb your surroundings.

5. Seek professional help if needed. Sometimes, self-care isn't enough. Don't hesitate to utilize on-campus resources for additional support in managing stress.
