Junior core has beaten me, chewed me up, and spit me back out. It has taken a large toll on my mentally. I really am a happy go lucky kind of person, but I felt as though I had so many responsibilities, which I did have, for this major I had many things that I needed to accompllish. One of the priorities that I let slip through the cracks was my own mental health. So I took the needed steps, met with a therapist, and learned a thing or two and I would like to share these tips with you so that maybe you can catch yourself slipping before you fall in a future semester, or even during this last week of finals. 

Mentally, juggling classes and managing multiple variables in life can get stressful! I know that Taking sophmore and junior core stressed me out beyond anyting else! I felt overwhelmed most of the time. I know that this is not a unique experience, so here are some tips to deal with this in the future.

1. Make activities that you enjoy a priority. Whether it is very physically demanding kick boxing to a chill walk in the evening, make physical activity a regular practice in your life, especially around finals. Stay committed, it may be hard to rationalize a good chunk of time to something that doesn't seem to be directly impacting your performance, but studies show that physical activity positively impacts mood, self-esteem, cognitive function, and social interaction. Exercise benefits individuals with serious mental illnesses, aiding weight control, fitness levels, and overall health. It does this by improving blood circulation to the brain and influencing the body's response to stress.
 
2. Eat balanced meals that are providing you with all of the vitmins and minerals that you need. In a seminar I attended the presenter, a therapist, said that vitamin D is a vitamin that during the winter we are all severely lacking, vitamin D when processed in the body helps regulate sleep, mood, and cortisol levels. Remember to eat the full myPlate we all learned in highschool health. A plate full of vegitables, fruits, protiens, and grains. Sugar can increase our stress levels. Caffine and Melatonin are just drugs that emulate funcitons the body should be performing naturally given the proper nutrition. Cut back on energy drinks and melatonin and see the mood and energy stability increase.

3. Surround yourself with positive people who uplift you. Having a support group around you can help you manage emotions and work through stress together as well as having a safety net of someone who will support you through tough times. This can look like a family member, friends, mentor, and peers. I find that bringing a spiritual aspect into the support group is always helpful. Have a closer relationship with your faith and do things that actively build these relationships. We are social beings and are not meant to be left alone. Reach out, ask for support and help and it is also always a good idea to take a break and spend time developing life outside of school and work. 

4. Sometimes, it can feel a bit all overwhelming. Take a break, take care of yourself. I konw that when I went to a seminar and the presenter told us it's okay to take a break from school and take care of ourselves, I thought to myself that she didn't know our major and surely it is impossible for you to take a break from school and have it not effect how you do. I have found that a little break once and a while, sometimes once every week, once every other week, can help with managing stress and focusing on self care and mental health so that it is cutting of the problem before it becomes a big problem.

5. Seek professional support if needed. Sometimes, self-care alone may not suffice. Don't hesitate to reach out to on-campus resources for additional guidance in managing stress. They're there to lend a helping hand when required.

It has been a difficult semester for me, and I know that I am not alone in this sentiment. There have been many frustrations, many sleepless nights, and many incompleted assignments, but hey, we made it, and we can make another semester!

Happy Hollidays,

Wishing everyone well and I hope this can help at least one person,
