Navigating through the demands of cyber junior core courses was an intense journey that left me feeling overwhelmed and drained. Despite my typically upbeat nature, the weight of numerous responsibilities associated with school took its toll. It became apparent overtime, that I slowly neglected my well being over academic stresses. 

Recognizing the need for a change, I sought external help from a therapist. Through this experience, I learned strategies that proved new insight of how to find balance amidst the chaos. 

This period of introspection taught me the importance of prioritizing self-care, even in the midst of demanding academic schedules. By implementing certain practices and recognizing warning signs early on, it’s possible to prevent oneself from succumbing to the pressures and stress that accompany rigorous coursework.

Consider these insights and strategies as tools to fortify your mental well-being during hard and easy times. Your academic pursuits are important, but so is your mental health, and finding that balance is key to thriving in both areas.

1. Make physical activities that you enjoy a priority. Whether it is very physically demanding kick boxing to a chill walk in the evening, make physical activity a regular practice in your life, especially around finals. Stay committed, it may be hard to rationalize a good chunk of time to something that doesn’t seem to be directly impacting your performance, but studies show that physical activity positively impacts mood, self-esteem, cognitive function, and social interaction. Exercise benefits individuals with serious mental illnesses, aiding weight control, fitness levels, and overall health. It does this by improving blood circulation to the brain and influencing the body’s response to stress.

2. Eat balanced meals that are providing you with all of the vitamins and minerals that you need. In a seminar I attended the presenter, a therapist, said that vitamin D is a vitamin that during the winter we are all severely lacking, vitamin D when processed in the body helps regulate sleep, mood, and cortisol levels. Remember to eat the full myPlate we all learned in high school health. A plate full of vegetables, fruits, proteins, and grains. Sugar can increase our stress levels. Caffeine and Melatonin are just drugs that emulate functions the body should be performing naturally given the proper nutrition. Cut back on energy drinks and melatonin and see the mood and energy stability increase.

3. Surround yourself with positive people who uplift you. Having a support group around you can help you manage emotions and work through stress together as well as having a safety net of someone who will support you through tough times. This can look like a family member, friends, mentor, and peers. I find that bringing a spiritual aspect into the support group is always helpful. Have a closer relationship with your faith and do things that actively build these relationships. We are social beings and are not meant to be left alone. Reach out, ask for support and help and it is also always a good idea to take a break and spend time developing life outside of school and work.

4. Sometimes, it can feel a bit all overwhelming. Take a break, take care of yourself. I know that when I went to a seminar and the presenter told us it’s okay to take a break from school and take care of ourselves, I thought to myself that she didn’t know our major and surely it is impossible for you to take a break from school and have it not effect how you do. I have found that a little break once and a while, sometimes once every week, once every other week, can help with managing stress and focusing on self care and mental health so that it is cutting of the problem before it becomes a big problem.

5. Seek professional support if needed. Sometimes, self-care alone may not suffice. Don’t hesitate to reach out to on-campus resources for additional guidance in managing stress. They’re there to lend a helping hand when required.

It has been a difficult semester for me, and I know that I am not alone in this sentiment. There have been many frustrations, many sleepless nights, and many uncompleted assignments, but hey, we made it, and we can make another semester!

Happy Hollidays,

Wishing everyone well and I hope this can help at least one person,
